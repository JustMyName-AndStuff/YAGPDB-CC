# Suggestion System (UNFINISHED!!!)
# I temporarily removed the system from github as I was encountering far too many bugs. Once I get it all fixed up and done I'll post it again

**There are a few suggestion systems out there, however all require around 4 CCs, my goal was to get as much into a single CC as possible. And this is what I have till now:**

-a suggestionshelp/suggestions help command that gives you all available commands (OPTIONAL)

-a suggest command to submit suggestions *(obviously)*

-a decision command (approve/deny/consider/implement) *also quite obvious*

-a configurable cooldown on the suggest command so suggestions can't be spammed

-choose which colors should be used for the different suggestion statuses (default/approved/denied/considered/implemented)

-option to choose a "decision channel" where approved/denied and implemented suggestions are sent (OPTIONAL)

-choose which prefix should be used for the suggestion system (default prefix is "-")

**What is still coming up:**

-editsuggestion command

-deleteSuggestion command

-Reaction CC that will limit suggestions to 1 vote per user and dynamically change the color based on number of upvotes/downvotes
