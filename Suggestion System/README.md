# Suggestion System

**There are a few suggestion systems out there, however most require around 4 CCs, my goal was to get as many features into as few CCs as possible. And this is what I have till now:**

-a suggestionshelp/suggestions help command that gives you all available commands

-a suggest command to submit suggestions *(obviously)*

-a decision command (approve/deny/consider/implement)

-a configurable cooldown on the suggest command so suggestions can't be spammed

-choose which colors should be used for the different suggestion statuses (default/approved/denied/considered/implemented)

-option to choose a "decision channel" where approved/denied and implemented suggestions are sent (OPTIONAL)

-choose which prefix should be used for the suggestion system (default prefix is "-")

-editsuggestion command with a configurable cooldown

-deletesuggestion command

-comment command

-anonymous suggestions (OPTIONAL)

**What is still coming up:**

-revoke command that revokes a decision made on a suggestion (changes suggestion back to default)

-Reaction CC that will dynamically change the color based on number of upvotes/downvotes
