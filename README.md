# Collection of Custom Commands for the Discord Bot YAGPDB.xyz

**This is a collection of CCs I am making, currently there is:**

-Custom Reaction Ticket System

**What will be added in the future:**

-Suggestion System with dynamic change of embed colors

-CC to automatically remove a persons reaction for a rolemenu (currently a premium-only option, requires a CC to work for non-premium users)

-An RPG bot (currently I have a currency system setup and I am thinking of turning it into an RPG bot)
