# Yet-Another-Reaction-Ticket-System
Reaction Ticket Systems seem to be quite popular so I decided to make my own as I didn't like tha fact that other systems used so many ccs.

**The benefits this system has over the standard ticket system:

-Automatically deletes tickets after a certain amount of time being inactive (the time of inactivity can be configured, standard is 3h inactivity)

-Only one ticket per person can be open at a time

-There's a configurable per-user cooldown for opening tickets to prevent people from opening multiple tickets in a short amount of time (the cooldown can also be configured, or disabled if not wanted, standard cooldown is 30 minutes)

-you can have a custom prefix that is dedicated to the commands add/adduser, remove/removeuser, rename and resend (the standard prefix is "-")

-the system works completely with reactions, except for the command that require arguments to use (rename, adduser, removeuser)

-you can have logs/a transcript of the ticket sent to you in DM without having to close the ticket

**Requirements/Recommendations to make this system work properly:

disable all standard ticket commands under control panel > core > command settings > command ovverrides

**Benefits this has over other reaction ticket systems:

-uses only 2 CCs and therefore takes up little space and takes less time to add

-fits a lot of functionality into only 2 CCs
