{{/*This is the "Reaction Listener" command. It is the main part of the ticket system.

 

          In order to initially set up the ticket system, you must react with ANY STANDARD EMOJI (not custom emoji) on the

          message where people can open tickets on (THIS MUST BE DONE IN THE SAME CHANNEL AND THE REACTION MUST

          BE ADDED TO THE SAME MESSAGE AS PROVIDED IN THE $openmsg VARIABLE!)

 

Trigger type: Reaction

Option to choose: Added Reactions only

 

This is the main set-up cc, in the Code for the "Opening message in new tickets" response box there are 2 more values that can be optionally changed

these values are:

-The time until tickets are closed for inactivity

-The prefix of the resend, add/adduser, remove/removeuser and rename command
